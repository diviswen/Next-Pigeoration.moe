1. Now I'm working on generating colored paintings from sketches.
2. The network is based on SRResNet (code borrowed from https://github.com/zsdonghao/SRGAN) with some modification on the generator.
3. I tried WGAN and DRAGAN instead of the original form of GAN and found that WGAN works pretty well.

Here are some results:
